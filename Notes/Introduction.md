# Introduction

## Artificial Intelligence v.s. Machine Learning

* Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence.
* Machine learning makes decisions based on data it has seen, but Not all AI algorithms need to do this.
* Many of the latest AI systems  all make use of ML.
* For this reason, many people  use the terms AI and ML  interchangeably.


## Why do we use ML?
* Some tasks are too complex for us to fully describe on our own .
* ML gives us a way to tell the computer how to learn without needing to describe what to learn.

## Elements of a ML Algorithm
###  Representation: 
how we are gathering and processing our data.
* Linear regression.
* Neural Networks.

### Optimization: 
how to best find the patterns that fit our data.
* Backpropagation.
* Rule Learning.

### Evaluation: 
how accurate those patterns are.
* Accuracy.
* Squared Error.

## Types of Machine Learning
*  Supervised Learning
*  Unsupervised Learning 
*  Semi-supervised Learning
*  Reinforcement Learning
